Charter schools outperformed District schools in math and reading test scores by nearly 36.76% overall. Also, 11th and 12th grade students clearly showed higher math and reading scores likely in preparation for continuing education."

If we compare these schools with the Total Students, there is a correlation between student population and Overall Passing %. The data shows that a higher student population will negatively impact the Overall Passing Rate, therefore, having a lower math and reading passing average. This can also be referenced in the Average Scores by School Size data set.\n",
