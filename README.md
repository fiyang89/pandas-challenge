# Py City Schools

### Background

You are the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. In this capacity, you'll be helping the school board and mayor make strategic decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task, you've been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. You'll be given access to every student's math and reading scores, as well as varios information on the schools they attend. Your task is to aggregate the data to showcase obvious trends in school performance.

### Summary of Analysis

In summary, Charter schools show promising results for standardized testing based on high math and reading scores. Charter schools outperformed District schools in math and reading test scores by nearly 36.76% overall. Also, 11th and 12th grade students clearly showed higher math and reading scores likely in preparation for continuing education.

### Conclusion

Based on datasets from Highest-Performing Schools and Lowest-Performing Schools depicting students who passed both math and reading, the overall passing percentages were highest in Charter schools and lowest in District schools. If we compare these schools with the Total Students, there is a correlation between student population and Overall Passing %. The data shows that a higher student population will negatively impact the Overall Passing Rate, therefore, having a lower math and reading passing average. This can also be referenced in the Average Scores by School Size data set.

Based on datasets from Average Math Scores by Grade and Average Reading Scores by Grade, it can be concluded that the highest average scores in math and reading were from Charter schools. Specfically, 11th Graders at Holden High School had the highest average math score and 12th graders, also at Holden High School, had the highest average reading score.
